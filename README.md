# RockStyle Chess

A mobile chess app built with Expo Router (SDK 54) + React Native, styled as a
"rockstar arena" experience. Chess itself, the five-tier bot ladder, and real
online multiplayer (with accounts, Elo, and match history) are fully wired up
end-to-end. Most of the surrounding meta-game — shop, social, daily
rewards — is still UI rendering mock data over Stitch-generated designs,
being wired up incrementally on top of the database schema that already
exists for it.

## Features

**Real / working**
- **Chess engine** — `chess.js` drives all legality, check/checkmate/
  stalemate/draw detection; the app only renders and dispatches moves.
- **Five-tier bot ladder** (`src/lib/botEngine.ts`) — a from-scratch
  negamax/alpha-beta heuristic bot, iteratively deepened against a shared
  time budget (time-budgeted to stay responsive on React Native's single JS
  thread) for easy (1-ply) and medium (up to 3-ply), and three Stockfish 18
  WASM tiers (basic ~1600 Elo / lite ~2000 Elo / strong ~2800 Elo) run
  inside a hidden `react-native-webview` (`src/components/StockfishEngine.tsx`).
- **Local pass-and-play** and **bot matches**, fully client-side, no server
  required.
- **Real online multiplayer** — matchmaking by venue tier, live move sync,
  resign/forfeit, and reconnection within a grace window, via a companion
  Socket.IO server (`server/`). Every move is re-validated server-side with
  `chess.js` again before being broadcast — the client's own check is only
  for instant UI feedback, never trusted alone.
- **Self-hosted accounts** — email/password sign-up and sign-in, bcrypt +
  JWT sessions, wired end-to-end from the `(auth)` screens through the
  server.
- **Persistence** — PostgreSQL (via Drizzle ORM) stores accounts, player
  profiles, Elo ratings, and match history. Elo (K=32) and win/loss/streak
  stats update automatically after every online match between two
  authenticated players. Persistence writes happen *after* the realtime
  broadcast, fire-and-forget — a database hiccup degrades to "this result
  didn't save," never to blocked or broken gameplay.
- **Safe-area-aware layout** across every screen (notch/status bar, gesture
  bar, bottom nav all accounted for).

**UI-only / mock (not backed by real data yet)**
- Shop (chip/gem packs, VIP), Forge (cosmetics), Rewards (daily bonus,
  quests, achievements, spin wheel, collections), and Social (friends,
  bands, messages, world rankings, front-row spectate) all render hardcoded
  arrays today. Their Postgres tables already exist — see
  [Database](#database) — but no endpoints or screen wiring consume them
  yet; this is deliberately scoped as follow-up work, not an oversight.

## Tech stack

**Client**
- Expo SDK 54, Expo Router (file-based routing + route groups), React 19,
  React Native 0.81
- `chess.js` — chess rules engine
- `react-native-reanimated` / `react-native-gesture-handler` — board
  animation and drag/tap interaction
- `react-native-webview` — hosts the Stockfish WASM build for the two
  hard-mode bots
- `socket.io-client`, `expo-secure-store` (JWT), `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
  (persisted guest id for unauthenticated play)

**Server** (`server/` — a separate Node.js project with its own
`package.json`, deployed independently)
- Express + Socket.IO — realtime match and matchmaking layer
- PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (`drizzle-kit` for migrations)
- `bcryptjs` + `jsonwebtoken` — auth

Most directories have their own `README.md` with more detail on individual
files and design decisions (why a file exists, what Stitch mockup it came
from, what's still a stub) — check those first when working in a given
area. `server/README.md` in particular documents the full Socket.IO
protocol and the auth/persistence design.

## Setup

### Client

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # set EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL, see below
npx expo start
```

Open in Expo Go, or a dev build. `chess.js`, the bot ladder, and local
pass-and-play all work with no server running at all. Online multiplayer
and accounts need the server below; `EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` should point
at it — your machine's LAN IP + port when developing against a physical
device (Expo Go can't resolve `localhost` to your dev machine). Day-to-day
this should be your **local** server from the section below, not the
deployed Railway one — that keeps every edit-and-reload cycle off the real
production database. Temporarily swap in the deployed `wss://` URL only
when you deliberately want to smoke-test against production; Expo
specifically recommends against relying on multiple auto-loaded `.env.*`
files for this kind of switch (`expo export`/EAS always force
`NODE_ENV=production`, making file selection unpredictable), so this one
`.env` value is a manual edit, same as the server's local-vs-remote split
below.

### Server (multiplayer + database)

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env       # set DATABASE_URL to your local Postgres, + JWT_SECRET
npm run db:migrate         # apply pending migrations (local DB)
npm run dev                # tsx watch src/index.ts, listens on :4000
```

Requires a reachable PostgreSQL instance (`DATABASE_URL`) — a local
Postgres install (or `createdb`'d database) for day-to-day development,
kept entirely separate from the Neon database that backs production. See
**"Local development vs. production"** in `server/README.md` for the full
local-DB setup and the `:remote` npm scripts that deliberately push a
tested migration/seed change to the real Neon database once it's approved
— that split, plus a normal `git push` for the Railway deploy itself, is
the whole "promote local changes to production" workflow. Also see
`server/README.md` for the full protocol reference, why Drizzle over
Prisma, and why auth is self-hosted rather than a third-party provider.

### Redeploying the server to Railway

The one-time Railway/Neon project setup is in `server/README.md`. Once that
exists, shipping a server code change is just:

```bash
cd server
railway up --detach   # builds + deploys the local server/ dir directly
```

The service is already linked (`railway status` from `server/` resolves to
project `RockStyleChess`, service `server`, environment `production`), so
this pushes straight from your working tree via the Railway CLI — no
`git push` + auto-deploy round trip needed, and no extra `DATABASE_URL` step
either (it's already set as a Railway service variable pointing at the
production Neon database). Poll `railway status --json` for the new
deployment's `status` (`BUILDING` → `DEPLOYING` → `SUCCESS`), then confirm
with:

```bash
curl https://server-production-62b1.up.railway.app/health   # -> {"ok":true}
```

Client builds that should hit this instead of your local dev server need
root `.env`'s `EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` pointed at that same URL (see the
note in **Client** above — it's a manual edit, remember to swap it back for
local dev afterward).

### Android (local build)

`android/` is gitignored (standard Expo managed workflow, regenerated on
demand) — generate it, then build with Gradle directly, no EAS account
needed:

```bash
npx expo prebuild -p android   # generates android/, safe to re-run
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease       # standalone APK, bundles JS statically
# or: ./gradlew assembleDebug   # see warning below
```

**Use `assembleRelease` for anything you're going to install and actually use
off this machine.** `assembleDebug` produces an APK that does *not* bundle
the JS — it connects to a Metro dev server over
`ws://localhost:8081/message` at runtime and fetches the bundle live. Without
that server reachable (which it never is for a standalone install on a real
device), the app hangs on the splash screen forever, silently retrying the
websocket connection — no crash, no error, just stuck. `assembleRelease`
runs `bundleReleaseJsAndAssets` and packages the JS into the APK itself, so
it needs nothing else running.

If `android/` already exists and nothing native-facing changed (no new
native module, no `app.json` plugin/icon changes), you can skip
`prebuild` and just re-run Gradle directly against the existing `android/`.

Things that aren't obvious the first time:

- **`android/local.properties` isn't committed** (machine-specific SDK path)
  — create it with `sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/Sdk` if it's missing, or export
  `ANDROID_HOME`.
- **Needs a full JDK 17, not just a `java` binary on `PATH`.** Gradle's
  toolchain resolution can pick a JRE-only Java install (some distros ship a
  headless `java-21` package with no `javac`) and fail deep into the build
  with a confusing "does not provide the required capabilities: JAVA_COMPILER"
  error. Point `JAVA_HOME` at a JDK that actually has `javac` if that
  happens, e.g. `JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64 ./gradlew ...`.
- The pinned NDK version (currently `27.1.12297006`, see the Gradle error if
  it drifts) has to be installed once: `sdkmanager "ndk;<version>"`.
- **The native build is disk-hungry (2GB+ in `android/app/build` alone) —
  fatal if the repo lives on a drive that's nearly full**, which is the case
  here (this repo is on an exFAT SD card). A build that dies mid-way with
  `No space left on device` can leave CMake/ninja's intermediate state (and
  Kotlin's compiled classes for individual Expo modules) corrupted badly
  enough that even `./gradlew clean` fails trying to reconfigure it, or
  succeeds but leaves one module's stale compiled output behind (see the
  `expo-modules-core`/`AnyTypeCache` note below — that's how it was
  discovered: a partial cleanup that missed one module's `android/build`).
  If a build dies from disk space, free space first, then nuke **every**
  module's native build output rather than hand-picking which ones —
  cheaper than debugging a stale-cache mismatch later:
  ```bash
  find node_modules -maxdepth 3 -type d \( -path "*/android/build" -o -path "*/android/.cxx" \) \
    | xargs rm -rf
  rm -rf android/app/build android/build android/app/.cxx android/.gradle
  ```
  then re-run `./gradlew assembleRelease`.
- **`package.json` has an `"overrides": { "expo-asset": "~12.0.13" }`.**
  Don't remove it without understanding why: `expo-audio@1.1.1` declares an
  unbounded `"expo-asset": "*"` dependency, which npm resolves to whatever
  the latest published `expo-asset` is (was `57.0.13`, a version from a
  completely different/newer Expo SDK generation) and hoists to the top of
  `node_modules` — shadowing the `~12.0.13` that `expo@54.0.35` actually
  needs, which gets nested under `node_modules/expo/node_modules/expo-asset`
  instead. Android's autolinking picks up the wrong top-level one; its
  compiled Kotlin references an `expo-modules-core` internal API
  (`AnyTypeCache`) that doesn't exist in the older, actually-installed
  `expo-modules-core`, and the app crashes with `NoClassDefFoundError` right
  after the splash screen hands off to JS — no build error, only a runtime
  crash, and a full clean rebuild alone does *not* fix it (only re-resolving
  `node_modules` to a single consistent version does). Verify with
  `npm ls expo-asset` — it should show one version, not two, before trusting
  a build.

Output lands at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` (or
`.../debug/app-debug.apk` if you built that variant). The release build type
currently signs with the Expo-generated debug keystore
(`android/app/debug.keystore`) — fine for sideloading/testing, but swap in a
real release keystore before shipping to the Play Store.

## Architecture

- **Client chess state** — `useChessGame` (`src/hooks/useChessGame.ts`)
  wraps a single `chess.js` instance in React state. It never implements
  chess rules itself — it asks chess.js and mirrors the answer into a
  render-friendly snapshot. Its `mode` selects between `'bot'`, `'local'`,
  and `'online'`; online mode routes moves through the shared Socket.IO
  connection (`src/lib/socket.ts`) instead of applying them directly, and
  reconciles incoming opponent moves from the server.
- **Bots** — `src/lib/botEngine.ts` dispatches by difficulty to
  `randomBot.ts` (easy), `heuristicBot.ts` (medium — negamax with alpha-beta
  pruning and a hard wall-clock deadline so a complex position can't freeze
  the UI thread), or the Stockfish WebView bridge (`StockfishEngine.tsx` +
  `stockfishProtocol.ts`) for the two hard tiers.
- **Multiplayer server** — a single Socket.IO instance holds the
  matchmaking queue and live match state (`chess.js` instances) in process
  memory. Deliberately not Redis-backed: one instance is simpler and has
  fewer failure modes than a horizontally-scaled Socket.IO + Redis-adapter
  setup, and isn't needed until real load demands it (see
  `server/README.md`). Every move is authoritatively re-validated
  server-side before being broadcast to both players.
- **Auth** — self-hosted, not a third-party provider: bcrypt-hashed
  passwords and JWT sessions (`server/src/auth.ts`,
  `server/src/authMiddleware.ts`). Sockets carry the JWT in the connection
  handshake; a missing or invalid token doesn't reject the connection, it
  just means that seat plays as an anonymous guest (`src/lib/playerId.ts`'s
  persisted device UUID) — guest play works identically, it's just never
  persisted.
- **Persistence** — match results are written to Postgres *after* the
  realtime broadcast that actually ends the match, fire-and-forget, and
  only when both seats are authenticated accounts
  (`server/src/db/persistMatchResult.ts`). A DB failure is logged
  (`console.error`) and never blocks or crashes gameplay; every async
  Express route handler is similarly wrapped (`server/src/asyncHandler.ts`)
  so a database outage can't take the whole process down.
